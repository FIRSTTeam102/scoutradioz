## How to set up for development
1. Clone repository `https://github.com/FIRSTTeam102/scoutradioz.git`.
2. Make sure you have Amazon's AWS CLI installed (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
3. Run `aws configure`.
    - Enter access key ID
    - Enter secret access key
4. Make sure `.env` is populated with necessary environment variables for your system.
5. Make sure `databases.json` is populated with necessary database information. (If `.database` does not exist, it defaults to `localhost:27017`)
    - `databases.json` must be in JSON format
    - For each process "tier" (`process.env.TIER`), include a Mongo database URL, as well as a default fallback. (e.g. `dotdatabase.app.url`. `dotdatabase.beta.url`, `dotdatabase.default.url`)
6. This project has already been configured. To deploy, run `npm run package-deploy`. On Windows, run `npm run win-package-deploy`.

## About
This is a merge from our ScoringApp-2018 with AWS Labs' Express basic-starter example. (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express/tree/master/examples/basic-starter)

Currently the project is bare-bones. We need to slowly add functionality as we rework our routes, to make sure they work with Lambda.
